// Array Methods with Callbacks Practice

// Below are exercises in using array methods that use callbacks. Beneath each prompt write the code to fulfill the exercise requirement.

// Exercise 1
// Consider this variable:
var numbers = [1, 5, 3, 7, 8]
// Write a function called isOdd that determines if a number is odd. Then use the filter method on the numbers array using the isOdd function as the callback to return all the odd numbers from the numbers array.

// Exercise 2
// Write a function called isEven that determines if a number is even. Then use the filter method on the numbers array using the isEven function as the callback to return all the even numbers from the  numbers array.

// Exercise 3
// Consider this variable:
var sites = ["codepen.io", "codecademy.com", "coursera.org", "egghead.io", "udemy.com", "pluralsight.com", "udacity.com", "sitepoint.com"]
// Write a function called dotCom that determines if a string contains .com. Then use the filter method on the sites array using the dotCom function as the callback to return all the sites that contain .com.

// Exercise 4
// Write a function called dotIo that determines if a string contains .io. Then use the filter method on the sites array using the dotIo function as the callback to return all the sites that contain .io.

// Exercise 5
// Write a function called dotOrg that determines if a string contains .org. Then use the filter method on the sites array using the dotOrg function as the callback to retrun all teh sites that contain .org.

// Exercise 6
// Write the code that uses an array method that takes the dotCom function as a callback and returns whether or not the sites array contains any .com sites.

// Exercise 7
// Write the code that uses an array method that takes the dotCom function as a callback and returns whether or not the sites array only contains .com sites.

// Exercise 8
// Write the code that uses an array method that takes the dotIo function as a callback and returns whether or not the sites array contains any .io sites.

// Exercise 9
// Write the code that uses an array method that takes the dotIo function as a callback and returns whether or not the sites array only contains .io sites.

// Exercise 10
// Write the code that uses an array method that takes the dotCom function as a callback and returns the first instance of a .com site.
