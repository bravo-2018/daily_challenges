// Loops/Iteration Practice

// Below are exercises in using loops and iteration. Beneath each prompt write the code to fulfill the exercise requirement.

// Exercise 1
// Write a for loop that logs each number from 1 - 20.

// Exercise 2
// Write a for loop that logs the result of each number from 1 - 20 tripled.

// Exercise 3
// Consider this variable:
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
// Write for loop that logs each number.

// Exercise 4
// Create a for loop that logs each EVEN number from 1-20, and in the place of every odd number, returns the word "ODD"
// So the result should be: [ODD, 2, ODD, 4, ODD, 6 ....]

// Exercise 5
// Your friend is training for a marathon and you are going to help them. They are running on a track, but often lose count of how many loops they have done. You need to create a for loop to log their progress as they run. Create the code to satisify the pseudo code below:

// Initial number of laps is 0
// Track size: 1/4 mile
// Goal: Run 8 miles

// for(....create the loop condition ....) {
      // log laps until your friend has run their 8 miles
// }

// EXTRA: For extra challenge, add code that logs an encouraging message to your friend at the 4, 6, and 7 mile markers

// Exercise 6
// Use a forEach on the numbers variable above to log each number.

// Exercise 7
// Use a forEach on the numbers variable above to log the result of each number doubled.

// Exercise 8
// Use a for loop to log each number from the numbers variable above.

// Exercise 9
// Use a for loop to log whether each number from the numbers variable above is odd or even.

// Exercise 10
// Use a forEach on the numbers variable above to log whether each number is odd or even.

// Exercise 11
// Use for loop to log each number from the numbers variable above in reverse.

// Exercise 12
// Use a forEach on the numbers variable above to log each number in reverse. Hint: Another javascript array method might be necessary.
